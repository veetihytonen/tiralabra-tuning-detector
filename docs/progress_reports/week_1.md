# Progress report of week 1

This week was mostly research and ideation. I attended the kickoff lecture to gain so understanding about how feasible my idea was. I continued by researching papers on topics such as spectral analysis, especially with FFT, and pitching of music among other signal processing topics. It was not clear cut which algorithms are suitable for the project, especially for the pitching of the audio, so a large chunk of my time was spent on researching how pitching algorithms work. The first step for the actual program is to set up decoding of WAV files and start implementing the FFT algorithm.
